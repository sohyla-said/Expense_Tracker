# 💰 Expense Tracker CLI Application

A simple command-line **Expense Tracker** application built in Python to help manage personal finances.  
The application allows users to **add, update, delete, view, filter, summarize, and export expenses** with monthly budget tracking.
Can be used in two ways:
1. **Interactive CLI** – manage your expenses from the terminal using a text menu.
2. **Flask REST API** – expose all functionalities as HTTP endpoints.
